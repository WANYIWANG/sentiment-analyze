# Program For Cultural Heritage
Final Presentation: Sentiment Analysis of “Gene-Editing”tweets 
# My Github Repo: https://github.com/WANYIWANG/sentiment-analyze

# Project Description:
The final project of Programming for Culture Heritage is an integrity project with API request, data scraping and cleaning, semantical analyze, save data into csv file, and data visualization. 
Recently, A Chinese researcher used CRISPR - Cas9 technology that created the first gene-edited twin babies.
CRISPR is easier to use and more precise than previous methods, but it is not a perfect technology. It can lead to unintended consequences, such as affecting other genes (“off-target” effects) or making multiple modifications of the gene we are aiming to modify (“on-target” effects). There is an ongoing discussion as to how widespread “off target” and “on-targets” modifications are, and what the unintended consequences of these effects may be.
This technology Is not allowed in US and many other country. 
My topic is about the movement of #gene_editing on Twitter. I want to analysis US people’s opinions (positive or negative) about this issue by the distribution of region. 

# Procedure:
First of all, request tweets API from twitter, get the API key. Then 

The repository contains four folders.

# Result Analysis (still working on it)
From Nov 26 - Dec 1
1350 tweets from 15 country have been loaded in. 
703 out of 1350 tweets show negative attitude for #china gene editing 
EXP: JUST BECAUSE WE CAN DOES NOT MEAN WE SHOULD-Chinese Scientist Claims to Use Crispr to Make First Genetically Edited
375 out of 1350 tweets show neutral attitude for #china gene editing
EXP: the gene-edited embryo is meant to be born and could potentially suffer unknown consequences from it
272 out of 1350 tweets show positive attitude for #china gene editing
EXP: China baby gene-editing scientist defends his research , raises possibility of thirdembryo
However ' Proud '(sarcasm)appearance for many times in positive sentiment score result which means irony and sarcasm can not be tested by computer.
